# Digit_Recognition_Tensorflow
Creation of an Artificial Neural Network with Tensorflow and Keras. This ANN recognize the digits from 0 to 9, the Dataset that was handled is MNIST.


The specification of the Neural Network are:
- It has 3 layers.
- in input layer has 784 neurons.
- in hidden layer has 64 neurons with an sigmoid activation.
- in output layer has 10 softmax neurons, each neuron represents a digit.
The measure of the loss is mean squared error and a learning rate of 0.01.
